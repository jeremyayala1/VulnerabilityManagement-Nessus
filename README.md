<h1>Vulnerability Management - Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Lab</h1>

<!--
 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)
-->

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I set up a Windows 10 environment on a VMware Workstation Virtual Machine. I install some deprecated software on the VM to get some feedback. Then, I use Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner to run a vulnverability scan against the virtual machine to discover any vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities are discovered, I will work towards remediating the vulnerabilities to reduce exposure to the workstation.
<br />

<br />
<br />
After selecting "Customize Hardware", you can change resources around if you're familiar with your computer; otherwise, leave these alone.<br/>
 *** Most importantly: Select "Network Adapter" -> and under "Network connection" select "Bridged" <br/>
 This allows your PC running Nessus to be able to communicate with your VM easier <br/>
 Close and Finish <br/>
