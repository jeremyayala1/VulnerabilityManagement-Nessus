<h1>Vulnerability Management - Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Lab</h1>

<!--
 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)
-->

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I set up a Windows 10 environment on a VMware Workstation Virtual Machine. I install some deprecated software on the VM to get some feedback. Then, I use Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner to run a vulnverability scan against the virtual machine to discover any vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities are discovered, I will work towards remediating the vulnerabilities to reduce exposure to the workstation. I've written this as a guide for you to follow along if you also wish to learn Nessus and Vulnerability Scanners.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Tenable Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMware Workstation Player</b>
- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
We are going to test connectivity to our virtual machine by pinging it from our host machine <br/>
 Open cmd on your host computer, type "ping (the IPv4 of your VM) -t" <br/>
 Initially, you'll notice that the requests time out (VM can't be pinged) <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VGd6vG.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
  **NOTE: In a live production environment, this is NOT recommended. Disabling the firewall is strictly for the application of this lab** <br/>
To enable connectivity, we're going to disable the firewall <br/>
 On the VM, type "wf.msc" on the search bar at the bottom <br/>
 Select "Windows Defender Firewall Properties" <br/>
 Turn "Firewall state" to "Off" on the Domain, Private, and Public profiles <br/>
 You'll notice on your host machine that pings are able to receive a response

<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
You may close the command prompt on the host machine since we have established that we can make a connection <br/>
 Open your Nessus Essentials tab and select "New Scan" -> Basic Network Scan <br/>
 Name your scan and place the IPv4 address of your VM in the "Targets" section. Select Save <br/>
 This first scan will be a non-credientialed scan (because we have not provided admin login) <br/>

<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
By clicking on "Vulnerabilities", you are able to see the findings of the scan <br/>
 Depending on your organization's posture, there will be some vulnerabilities that are far more important to remediate than others <br/>
 Here is an example of one of the vulnerabilities found, possible solutions, and the CVSS scores <br/>
 If you aren't familiar with CVSS scores, they are a qualitative measure of (a vulnerability's) severity. <br/>
 Other bullets seen may simply be informative and not a vulnerability <br/>

<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
 We're going to configure the VM to allow credentialed scans <br/>
 Type "services.msc" on the search bar below <br/>
 Locate and enable "Remote Registry" by setting "Startup type" to "Automatic" -> Apply -> Start <br/>
 You may close all open windows within the VM <br/>

<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
 **Note: This is not recommended in a production environment. We are simply using these settings to make it easier to scan. <br/>
You're going to add a key to the registry that supposed to further disable the user access control for remote access <br/>
 Type "Registry Editor" in the search below <br/>
 Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CurrentVersion -> Policies -> System <br/>
 Verify that your path matches picture below <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fdrCovR.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/> <br/>
Right click where you see the files on the right, select New -> DWORD (32-bit) Value <br/>
Name it "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy", hit enter, set Value data to 1 <br/>
Close the window, restart your VM, and log back in <br/>

<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
Congratulations on your second scan! As a reminder, this was a credentialed scan which gave us an even better look into vulnerabilities <br/>
 Let's compare the first (non-credentialed) scan to the second (credentialed) scan. <br/>
 First scan: <br/>
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hy0dapU.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
 <br/>
 Second scan: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wu0Ux4V.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
Navigating to "Vulnerabilities" after the credentialed scan, we can begin to take a dive into what is making our VM susceptible <br/>
 The vulnerability group with the highest count (103) of vulnerabilities appears to be Microsoft Edge <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qnpaRZQ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
We can also check the "Remediations" tab to see what we are able to do as security professionals to remediate these vulnerabilities <br/>
 Most of these remediation recommendations are tied to Windows Updates, and in production environments, third party updates as well <br/>
 A good idea is to see how we can automate a lot of these repetitive and necessary updates to protect company systems (Windows or Third Party patching) <br/>
 Part of this automation would be testing and deploying these updates on regular intervals <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8uE4j5m.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
 **Note: This is not recommended in a production environment. We are simply doing this exercise to simulate vulnerabilities. <br/>
Within the VM, navigate to a browser (Edge) and look up "Firefox old download" <br/>
 This will bring you to a directory. Install an older (exposed) version of Firefox for another scan. <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JKmqroN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
In my case, I'm installing 3.5.10 by navigating to /pub/firefox/releases/3.5.10/wind32/en-US and downloading the .exe file <br/>
 Run the .exe and fully install Firefox <br/>
 Once this deprecated Firefox is installed, we can go back to our host machine to run another scan <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pg34mbK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
Back on our Host Machine, we'll nagivate back to Nessus Essentials and run another scan from our pre-configured scan <br/>
 Congratulations on your third scan! As we've progressed, we'll notice more and more critical and high vulnerabilities <br/>
 Let's compare all 3 of the scans conducted: <br/>
  First scan (non-credentialed): <br/>
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hy0dapU.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
 <br/>
 Second scan (credentialed): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wu0Ux4V.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
 <br/>
 Third scan (credentialed + deprecated software): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wP91ull.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***ON YOUR HOST MACHINE AND NOT IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE*** <br/>
We can also dive into the last scan to see groupings of vulnerabilities and remediations <br/>
 Good thing to note: a great way to handle these vulnerabilities could be simply to update or uninstall the deprecated software <br/>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/htRZ50f.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
Let's work on remediating these vulnerabilities <br/>
 In this scenario, your organization has decided to use Chrome, so Firefox is not necessary to have installed at this time  <br/>
 Type "Run" in the search bar and type "appwiz.cpl" <br/>
 Locate and Uninstall Firefox <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QHq6i6t.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Sentinel SIEM Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
***IN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE AND NOT ON YOUR HOST MACHINE*** <br/>
Navigate to Windows Update from the search bar below <br/>
 Check for and install updates, restart the VM, and rinse and repeat until up-to-date <br/>
 You should also check third party vulnerabilities that can updated (which wouldn't be on the Windows Update) <br/>
